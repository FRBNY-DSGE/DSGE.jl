The reason is that the gensys regimes are computed before the gensys2 regimes, and to avoid extra calculations, the terminal period is computed during the gensys2 step.

See Advanced Usage for a more detailed explanation on changing subspecs.\nThe names of the observables must exist as either observables or pseudo-observables in the DSGE because for most DSGEVAR methods, we need to construct the state space representation of the DSGEVAR using information from the underlying DSGE.\nIt is important to be careful about the order of the observables when constructing a DSGEVAR. Whether you define the names of the observables by calling update! or by creating a subspec, we assume that the order of the observables corresponds to the observable's index in the data and in the state space representation of the DSGEVAR. In the example provided above, if we estimate the DSGEVAR on data or construct the state space representation of the DSGEVAR, we assume that the order of observables in the data array, which has dimensions nobs x nperiods, is :obs_gdp in the first row, :obs_cpi in the second row, and :obs_nominalrate in the third row.\nWhen using functions that use the DSGE as a prior for a VAR (as opposed to a VAR approximation of the DSGE), then an intercept term is assumed and cannot be turned off. For example, the following two functions computes the VAR coefficients and innovations variance-covariance matrix for a DSGEVAR object m. The first one is for a VAR approximation of the DSGE in m, and it allows the user to specify whether or not they want an intercept term using the keyword use_intercept. The second function is for using the DSGE as a prior for a VAR estimated on data. This function does not have the use_intercept keyword because we require an intercept term when using the DSGE as a prior for a VAR.","category":"page"},{"location":"special_model_types/#DSGE-VECMs-and-the-DSGEVECM-Type-1","page":"Special Model Types","title":"DSGE-VECMs and the DSGEVECM Type","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"special_model_types/#","page":"Special Model Types","title":"Special Model Types","text":"We can extend DSGE-VARs to permit cointegrating relationships between observables using DSGE-VECMs. A VECM is a vector error-correction model, which extend VARs to account for long-run stochastic trends, i.e. cointegration..","category":"page"},{"location":"special_model_types/#","page":"Special Model Types","title":"Special Model Types","text":"For more details on the theory and performance, see Del Negro and Schorfheide (2004), Del Negro and Schorfheide (2006), and [Del Negro, Schorfheide, Smets, and Wouters (2007)][https://www.jstor.org/stable/27638915].","category":"page"},{"location":"special_model_types/#","page":"Special Model Types","title":"Special Model Types","text":"We implement DSGE-VECMs with the DSGEVECM concrete type so that it is easy to interface them with DSGE models.

As an example, let's consider the process of downloading and transforming the GDP series for use in the DSGE model. First, using the FredData.jl package, we pull the aggregate nominal GDP series (in dollars) from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) programmatically. Before the estimation, we transform this series into the appropriate units for the log-linearized model: quarter-to-quarter log differences of real, per-capita GDP.

Therefore, a given function is really no different than any other variable in Julia.

In the data step of the code, for instance, we can retrieve the name of the function by querying the Observable object and then apply the function to an appropriate set of arguments. This is a very direct method of looking up which transforms to apply, and simultaneously provides the opportunity for us to abstract common transformations into an appropriately named function.

Through this blocking, we can avoid keeping too much data in memory, since we only operate on a fraction of the parameter draws at any given time.

However, using distributed arrays also forced us to explicitly handle lower-level tasks like assigning parameter draws to processes. Since each process handled a predetermined set of draws, it was not easy to reallocate draws if some of the compute nodes on which the processes lived happened to be busier than others on a particular day.

In our experience, the Koopman smoother is faster than the standard Kalman smoother, as it does not require us to calculate the pseudo- inverses of the predicted variance matrices. For the same reason, we have also found that the Durbin and Koopman simulation smoother is faster than the Carter and Kohn one. All of these methods support time-varying matrices and variances. We use this feature to model pre–zero-lower-bound and zero-lower-bound regimes in our DSGE models, but the functionality is general enough to be applied to a wider range of models with regime switching or time varying matrices and variances.

To best isolate differences in the languages themselves, we can look at our code to compute the model solution with gensys and apply the Kalman filter with kalman_filter. These two functions have relatively little redesign and optimization as compared to the MATLAB code and provide the most comparable, though still imperfect, measurements of performance. The reduction of 1/5th to 3/4th in computing time, therefore, could be taken as a first estimate of Julia's advantage in this single arena of computation.","category":"page"},{"location":"MatlabToJuliaTransition/#Code-Improvements-1","page":"MATLAB to Julia Transition: Estimation","title":"Code Improvements","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"MatlabToJuliaTransition/#","page":"MATLAB to Julia Transition: Estimation","title":"MATLAB to Julia Transition: Estimation","text":"Julia provides versatile language features that allow us to improve our code's performance and clarity in several fundamental ways.

Here, one can store all information associated with the model – including the numerous parameters, priors, states, equilibrium conditions, computational settings, and flags – in one place.  By simply passing the model object as an argument to any function, the function has access to all of the model's fields.  By comparison, our MATLAB code stored all variables directly in the global workspace – an approach that scaled poorly as model specifications become more and more complex.
