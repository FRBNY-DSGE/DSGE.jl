load_data(m::AbstractModel; try_disk::Bool = true, verbose::Symbol = :low)
```

Create a DataFrame with all data series for this model, fully transformed.

First, check the disk to see if a valid dataset is already stored in `inpath(m, "data")`. A
dataset is valid if every series in `m.data_transforms` is present and the entire sample is
contained (from `date_presample_start` to `date_mainsample_end`. If no valid dataset is
already stored, the dataset will be recreated. This check can be eliminated by passing
`try_disk=false`.

If the dataset is to be recreated, in a preliminary stage, intermediate data series, as
specified in `m.data_series`, are loaded in levels using `load_data_levels`. See
`?load_data_levels` for more details.

Then, the series in levels are transformed as specified in `m.data_transforms`. See
`?transform_data` for more details.

The resulting DataFrame is saved to disk as `data_<yymmdd>.csv` and returned to the caller.

```
load_data_levels(m::AbstractModel; verbose::Symbol=:low)
```

Load data in levels by appealing to the data sources specified for the model. Data from FRED
is loaded first, by default; then, merge other custom data sources.

Check on disk in `inpath(m, "data")` datasets, of the correct vintage, corresponding to the
ones in `keys(m.data_series)`. Load the appropriate data series (specified in
`m.data_series[source]`) for each data source.

To accomodate growth rates and other similar transformations, more rows of data may be
downloaded than otherwise specified by the date model settings. (By the end of the process,
these rows will have been dropped.)

Data from FRED (i.e. the `:fred` data source) are treated separately. These are downloaded
using `load_fred_data`. See `?load_fred_data` for more details.

Data from non-FRED data sources are read from disk, verified, and merged.
