# DSGE.jl

```@meta
CurrentModule = DSGE
```

The DSGE.jl package implements the New York Fed DSGE model and provides
general code to estimate many user-specified DSGE models. The package is
introduced in the Liberty Street Economics blog post
[The FRBNY DSGE Model Meets Julia](http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/12/the-frbny-dsge-model-meets-julia.html).

This Julia-language implementation mirrors the MATLAB code included in the
Liberty Street Economics blog post
[The FRBNY DSGE Model Forecast](http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/05/the-frbny-dsge-model-forecast-april-2015.html).

The New York Fed DSGE team is currently working on adding methods to solve nonlinear and
heterogeneous agent DSGE models. Extensions of the DSGE model code may be released
in the future at the discretion of the New York Fed.
