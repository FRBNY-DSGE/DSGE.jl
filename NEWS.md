  + Added dataset identifier `Setting` with key `data_id`
  + Changed `cond_id` from `Setting{String}` to `Setting{Int}`
  + Moved raw input data files from `inpath(m, "data")` to `inpath(m, "raw")`

  before writing them to CSV.


## Breaking changes

- Added three optimization methods: `:simulated_annealing`, `:LBFGS`, and
  `:combined_optimizer` (which alternates between simulated annealing and
  LBFGS).
- Added the `PseudoObservable` type and the `pseudo_measurement` function, which
  defines pseudo-observables (linear combinations of states which are not
  observed) for each model, e.g. the output gap.
- Implemented the forecast step, a suite of functions that forecast using
  estimated parameters and compute means and bands of the forecasted series. The
  top-level functions are `forecast_one` and `means_bands_all`; see the
  [forecasting](http://frbny-dsge.github.io/DSGE.jl/latest/forecast.html) and
